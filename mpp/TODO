TO DO
------------------------------

[revision 2.00.000]
-----CONFIGURATION-----
[ ] Build a pool configuration based on a Virtual Server defined in the
    LVS/Piranha configuration file.
-----POOL-GLOBAL-----
[ ] Make Pollers aware of each other so that they can do the following:
--- [ ] Inherit the configuration of another poller sharing in a global
        failover or cluster. Read Poller XML config via HTTP request.
--- [ ] Replicate pool stats from a 'master' poller to a 'slave' poller. And
        have slave poller act as STANDBY. (Similar to a MySQL master/slave
        replication and failover)
--- [ ] Create internal pool of Pollers, so that there can be a more
        intelligent redundancy using the pool::failover::logic mechanism.
-----GUI-----
[ ] Add more features to the Web-based GUI

[revision 1.20.000]
-----GUI-----
[ ] Create *simple* web-based Graphical User Interface to configuring and
    managing the Poller and cached pools.
-----MANAGEMENT-----
[ ] Allow more micro management of objects in the pools, like the following:
--- [ ] Allow adding/renaming/deleting single servers from pools with ease
--- [ ] Allow creation of new servers/pools based on the configurations of
        existing servers/pools in the cache. (i.e. use same checkpoints..)

[revision 1.10.000]
-----GUI-----
[ ] Add a shell to the poller for managing the cache and polling (like SQL).

[revision 1.03.000]
-----REPORTING-----
[ ] Generate output optionally in XML upon request, using a 'xml' option flag,
    or 'format=xml'. Default output should still remain the human readable
    plain-text format that has already been used. Perhaps use MIME Types.

[revision 1.02.000]
-----POLLING-----
[ ] Add a timing mechanism to time how long it takes to make a poll iteration
    for a pool as well as the hosts in the pool. (Record result to log)
-----LOGGING-----
[ ] Update the Logging mechanism to allow the MODE of a log file to be set
[ ] Change the location of where the activity log is initialized so that
    requests via HTTP will not initialize the logging mechanism.
[ ] Split log file into seperate logs, one for each pool. So instead of having
    the one log file /tmp/cache_file.log we will now have multiple log files:
      /tmp/cache_file-poolname1.log
      /tmp/cache_file-poolname2.log
      etc...
[ ] Add to log output the timing results of polling. (From timing mechanism)

[revision 1.01.000]
-----GENERAL-----
[ ] Move code around so that objects only get created/invoked if the calling
    process requires it. (i.e. Do not initialize the log if called from HTTP,
    or when calling --list, or --cache-init (etc..) which do not use the
    logging object)

[revision 1.00.000]
-----GENERAL-----
[x] Make stable useful version
