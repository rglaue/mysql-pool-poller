MySQL Pool & Poller

ver 1.0.3


DESCRIPTION

This application and libraries are used to manage the individual statuses and
group states of mysql servers participating in a pool.

As of version 1.0, a failover pool is the only pool type that is configurable.
In a failover pool, one or more Real Servers participate as a group to keep a
Virtual Server up 24x7. With only one real server allowed to respond for
the Virtual Server at a single time. The Virtual Server's actual connectivity
is managed by a third-party redundancy mechanism. This MySQL Pool & Poller
application is used to determine which server is the ACTIVE server at any
given time.

This application is used to determine which MySQL Real Server participating in a
pool is the current ACTIVE server responding to requests for the MySQL Virtual
Server.

The redundancy mechanism simply makes a request asking if a particular server it
manages is supposed to be active or not. Supposedly, a server that is in a state
of ACTIVE will be the one responding for the Virtual Server while the remaining
MySQL servers in the pool will remain in a deactivated state, although
physically UP and running.


THIRD-PARTY REDUNDANCY MECHANISMS

The following load balancers have been tested with this application:
    Red Hat Cluster Suite (a.k.a. Piranha) (Built on top of LinuxVirtualServer)
        Red Hat Inc.

The following load balancers will be tested with this application in the future:
      MPP is in progress to be reworked and tested under MySQL Proxy
      MySQL Proxy (work completed r1.0.1, currently testing)

The following global load balancers are currently being tested for a future
