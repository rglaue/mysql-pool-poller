TO DO
------------------------------

[revision 1.02.000]
-----REPORTING-----
[ ] Generate output optionally in XML upon request, using a 'xml' option flag,
    or 'format=xml'. Default output should still remain the human readable
    plain-text format that has already been used. Perhaps use MIME Types.

[revision 1.01.000]
-----POLLING-----
[ ] Add a timing mechanism to time how long it takes to make a poll iteration
    for a pool as well as the hosts in the pool. (Record result to log)
-----LOGGING-----
[ ] Update the Logging mechanism to allow the MODE of a log file to be set
[ ] Change the location of where the activity log is initialized so that
    requests via HTTP will not initialize the logging mechanism.
[ ] Split log file into seperate logs, one for each pool. So instead of having
    the one log file /tmp/cache_file.log we will now have multiple log files:
      /tmp/cache_file-poolname1.log
      /tmp/cache_file-poolname2.log
      etc...
[ ] Add to log output the timing results of polling. (From timing mechanism)

[revision 1.00.000]
-----GENERAL-----
[x] Make stable useful version
