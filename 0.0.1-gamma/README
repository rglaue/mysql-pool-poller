ABOUT

The MPP Web Service extends the MPP monitoring to the web, using web 2.0 ideas.
The Web Service makes each MPP cachefile available via HTTP using XPath like
concepts. The powerhorse behind this ability is the XML::TreePP::XMLPath module
which can be used to transverse PERL HASH structures with an XPath like
accessor methodology.

This additionally allows external monitoring and load balancing services to
utilize MPP monitoring data easily via HTTP REST calls.

The MPP Web Client is a web-based dashboard. It collects XML structure from
MPP Web Services, translates them into a sanitized XML Document, and translates
the sanitized XML Document into a web-based dashboard interface using XSLT.

The web-based dashboard interface uses Web 2.0 concepts to retrieve regular
updates on MPP monitored objects identified by XPath like accessors. The use
of XPath like accessors for the objects allows quick and easy updates to
object values displayed in the dashboard.


INSTALL

1. Install the required PERL Modules:
  - Web Service
    o Data::Dump
    o XML::TreePP
    o XML::TreePP::XMLPath
  - Web Client
    o Data::Dump
    o XML::TreePP
    o XML::TreePP::XMLPath
    o XML::XSLT
    o XML::Tidy
    o CGI
    o JSON::PP
2. Extract this into "{MPP_Install_Directory}/ws".
3. Modify mpp-webservice.pl and mpp-webclient.pl to have the correct
   {MPP_Install_Directory}. The default is '/usr/local/mpp'.
4. Modify mpp-webservice.pl perl library path to mysqlpool::failover if the
   path is not the default '/usr/local/mpp/lib'.
5. Next follow the instructions in the CONFIGURATION section.


CONFIGURATION

This is the Apache configuration for the MPP Web Service.

# MPP Monitoring Web Configuration
# MPP Web Service
ScriptAlias /mpp /usr/local/mpp/ws/mpp-webservice.pl
# MPP Web Client
ScriptAlias /mpp-client /usr/local/mpp/ws/mpp-webclient.pl
Alias /mppdoc /usr/local/mpp/ws/doc
# End MPP Web Configuration

If you want both the Web Service and Web Client running on the same server,
add this entire block to the appropriate area of the Apache configuration.

If you plan to run the Web Client on a system separate from the Web Service,
add the Web Service and Web Client configurations separately to the Apache
configuration on the appropriate systems.

If you are concerned about protecting the MPP Web Service from unauthorized
access, you will want to use appropriate configuration in Apache to secure
this service. Since the web client does not handle username/password
authorization access to the Web Service, it is recommended to use the Apache
'allow from' rule to restrict access from certain IPs to the Web Service.
Access to the Web Client interface can be restricted however Apache is able
to handle authorization.


MPP Web Service

The Web Service (ws/mpp-webservice.pl) needs to be available on every system in
which MPP is running.

Edit the configuration (ws/mpp-webservice-config.xml) to indicate the location
of every active cache file, assigning a unique group name to identify each.


MPP Web Client

The Web Client (ws/mpp-webclient.pl and ws/doc) need only run on a single
system, from which it is wished to have the client run from.

Edit the first half (<services/>) of the configuration
(ws/mpp-webclient-config.xml) to indicate the locations and groups of all MPP
service you wish to monitor.
Edit the second half (<layout/>) of the configuration to indicate in which
order it is wished to have the service groups layed out.


LICENSE

The MPP Web Service maintains the same license as MPP.
