<b>Q. -----
How do I get Linux Virtual Server (LVS) to talk with MPP, and take actions?
</b>
<br />
I have set up a master-master MySQL configuration across two
database machines, and I have MPP on a designated Linux LVS machine. So
far I can poll my MySQL machines with no difficulty, and I have one as
ACTIVE and one as STANDBY.
<br />
How do I use the information that MPP produces within a LVS set up?

<br /><br />

<b>A</b>.
<br />

Have a look in the bin directory, particularly the script "server_is_active"
<code> &lt;MPP_INSTALL_DIR&gt;/bin/server_is_active </code>
<br />
For a simple failover solution where only the ACTIVE server is given out,
you should configure LVS to use this script as the monitoring script.
<br />
So, for every server LVS monitors, it will execute something like:
<code>  server_is_active [host] [port] </code>
<br />
If a server is ACTIVE, the text "up" will be returned.
And you should configure LVS to expect the string "up\n".
(You can change this my modifying the shell script.)
<br />
If the server is not ACTIVE, the text "down" will be returned.
<br />
Unless you have the "hostile-takeover" variable assigned as true, there will only
ever be one ACTIVE server at a time. And whatever server is ACTIVE is the server the
"server_is_active" script will respond with "up".
