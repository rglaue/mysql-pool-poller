MPP was released on its project host site, <a href="http://codepin.cait.org">CodePin.cait.org</a>, this year.
Its first publicly written debut was in an article published on MySQL Dev Central November 1st.
It is a three part article, part 1 and 2 are published, and the final part 3 is waiting to be published.
<ul>
<li> part 1 – 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/failover-strategy-part1.html">MySQL Failover Strategy using State Management, introducing MPP - Part 1</a>
(<a href="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp/docs/article1-part1/">local archive</a>)
<li> part 2 – 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/failover-strategy-part2.html">MySQL Failover Strategy using State Management, introducing MPP - Part 2</a>
(<a href="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp/docs/article1-part2/">local archive</a>)
<li> part 3 – 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/failover-strategy-part3.html">MySQL Failover Strategy using State Management, introducing MPP - Part 3</a>
(<a href="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp/docs/article1-part3/">local archive</a>)
</ul>
Part 1 covers general terms, technology and methods for failover.<br/>
Part 2 covers more MPP specifics and implementation with LVS.<br/>
Part 3 covers MPP's general configuration, as well as its combination into MySQL Proxy completed in MPP release 1.0.3.</br>
</p>

<p>
MPP is an Open Source project. The code is available freely at 
<a href="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp">http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp</a>
</p>

<p>
MPP was born before MySQL Proxy was known, and I wrote it to plug into any 
load-balancer that can execute shell scripts or make REST calls to determine 
node status. As of version 1.0.3 it can be plugged into MySQL Proxy.
Additionally, a working plan exists for the merger of MPP into the core
of MySQL Proxy as Lua script.
