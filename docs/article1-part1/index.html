<h1>MySQL Failover Strategy using State Management, introducing MPP</h1>
<em>Originally published on MySQL Developer Zone, 2007 @ http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/failover-strategy-part1.html</em>
<br />
<p>By Russell E Glaue</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<br />
<p>Having a strategy for failover has become almost standard in the
business world. Whether it is a total site failover from a NOC in one
city to another, or just a simple redundant server. Over the years
many technology solutions have been created for or adopted to MySQL
to provide this type of strategy.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h2>PART 1 -  Technology and Concepts for failover and Clustering</h2>
<BR />
<BR />
<p><B>INTRODUCTION</B></p>
<p>There are several technologies available today for pooling
multiple instances of MySQL into a general cluster or failover
solution. Several solutions are listed below in brief summary.
Following this are some basic terms used in general cluster and
failover ideas.</p>

	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>Developed by MySQL AB for the
		MySQL Server, this solution is entirely memory based and differs
		entirely from the traditional disk based MySQL Storage Engines. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>An advantage is that this is
		maintained and Supported by the MySQL Community, and is fast. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>A disadvantage is that the
		entirely memory based clustering engine The memory requirements for
		each individual node participating in a MySQL Cluster would be the
		equation of twice the size of stored data in the database +10%
		divided by the number of nodes (single node ram requirements =
		(SizeOfDatabase * NumberOfReplicas * 1.1) / NumberOfDataNodes)‚Äù</p>
		<LI><p>Beginning with MySQL 5.1.6, it is
		possible to store the non-indexed columns of NDB tables on disk
		rather than in RAM as with the previous version of MySQLCluster.
		However 5.1.6 still requires indexed fields including the primary
		key hash index to be stored in RAM.</p>
		<LI><p>MySQL 5.1 Carrier Grade addresses
		this limitation in MySQL Cluster further.

	<p><B>Continuent</B> uni/cluster and m/cluster products (Commercial)<br />
	<A HREF="http://www.continuent.com/">http://www.continuent.com/</A>
	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>Continuent provides a product(s)
		to cluster mysql similar to a multi-node cluster with heartbeat.
		But is more sophisticated by replicating SQL modification
		statements to all nodes, rather than rely on MySQL replication, and
		controlling the failover strategy. This product specific to MySQL
		is termed <EM>m/cluster</EM> . It also provides a clustering
		technique similar to Sequoia termed <EM>uni/cluster</EM> . 
		</p>
		<LI><p>Certainly if you want a company
		backing your MySQL cluster who you can hold accountable, you may
		wish to choose their product.

	<LI>
	<p><B>Sequoia</B> (Formerlly known as C-JDBC from ObjectWeb)<br />
	<A HREF="https://forge.continuent.org/projects/sequoia">https://forge.continuent.org/projects/sequoia</A>
	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>Developed originally by
		ObjectWeb, it has taken off as an Apache2 licensed solution now
		termed Sequoia. It is an entirely JDBC/ODBC solution for clustering
		JDBC/ODBC compliant database servers. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>Sequoia is a transparent
		middleware solution offering clustering, load balancing and
		failover services for any database. Sequoia is the continuation of
		the C-JDBC project. The database is distributed and replicated
		among several nodes and Sequoia balances the queries among these
		nodes. Sequoia handles node and network failures with transparent
		failover. It also provides support for hot recovery, online
		maintenance operations and online upgrades.

	<p><B>DRBD for MySQL High Availability</B><br />
	<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/drbd.html">http://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/drbd.html</A>
	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>DRBD for MySQL is a high
		availability solution that combines MySQL, Linux Heartbeat, and
		Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) so organizations can
		cost-effectively deliver High Availability (HA) database solutions.</p>
		<LI><p>An advantage is that the data
		replication is handled by DRBD, and does not require any
		replication by the MySQL processes to keep both nodes in sync.
		Additionally if one node is down for a long time, when brought back
		online, DRBD can bring it back into full synchronization in a very
		short time.</p>
		<LI><p>A disadvantage to this solution
		is DRBD currently only supports 2 nodes in its open source version,
		and the 2 node solution should reside on the same local network and
		not used between two separated sites.</p>
	</UL>
	<LI>
	<p><B>Linux Heartbeat / High Availability</B> <br />
	<a HREF="http://www.linux-ha.org/">http://www.linux-ha.org</a>
	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>Linux Heartbeat which is part of
		the High-Availability Project is a  traditional method used for
		configuring a failover scenario. One server is the primary server
		taking requests. The second server is on standby receiving
		replication from the primary. Once the primary has a hardware
		failure and a heartbeat can no longer be detected by the secondary
		server, then the secondary server takes over the application IP and
		serves requests in the primary's place. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>The advantage is that this is a
		widely used and tested scenario. DRBD and Heartbeat are both the
		most common mechanisms used for failover. Also, only the two
		participating server nodes need to have the heartbeat software
		installed. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>A disadvantage is that it is a
		one-server-up solution. The first server must come into error and
		be configured to give up use of the application IP to the secondary
		server. The High-Availability project is designed to do this.

		<LI><p>A Load Balancing DNS that allows
		for distributed services by resolving domain names to IP numbers
		across distributed multi-location server sites.</p>
		<LI><p>Primarily this solution is used
		to distribute traffic between multiple colocations by resolving a
		domain name(s) to IP number(s) for all configured colocations in
		turn to balance traffic among them.</p>

	<p><B>MPP (MySQL Pool-Poller) - The Topic of this Article</B><br />
	<A HREF="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp">http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp</A>
	</p>
	<UL>
		<LI><p>MPP is a MySQL State Manager. It
		is intended to be used in combination with any load balancing or
		traffic distribution management software. Its use has been tested
		in combination with Linux Virtual Server, Red Hat Cluster
		(Piranha), and F5 Networks BigIP. There is a plan to test its use
		with MySQL Proxy. This software allows the configuration of MySQL
		servers into a pool. The configured pool is managed based on a
		logic that is assigned to it. MPP currently supports a generic
		failover logic, and has intentions to eventually support a generic
		cluster logic. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>The advantage of this software is
		that it is a scenario management application, managing a pool of
		MySQL servers, leaving the implementation of the logic results to a
		2<SUP>nd</SUP> party application. MPP allows itself to be plugged
		into any 2<SUP>nd</SUP> party Load Balancing or Traffic Management
		software that can make external calls to scripts or which can
		implement REST based plugins. The Load Balancing and Traffic
		Management software is what executes the real implementation. So in
		theory, under an advanced technology configuration, MPP can be
		combined with several technologies to create a useful failover or
		cluster configuration. 
		</p>
		<LI><p>The disadvantage is that the code
		is fairly new as of this proof-of-concept release, and needs to be
		well field tested by many deployments and then fine tuned and
		optimized. Although already field tested and proven to work, it is
		only in its initial version and still has room for improvement.

<p><B>SOME BASIC TERMS</B></p>

<p><B>Pool</B></p>
<p>A Human Resource department may refer to a pool of employees that
fit a certain criteria, or even a pool of applicants applying for the
same job. This term is the same idea for a pool of servers. A pool is
defined to operate a certain function to achieve a common result. An
example would be a pool of servers to serve up a company's website,
say http://www.eraser.com for a fictional eraser company.</p>
<p>To serve a web site you will need servers that will answer the
HTTP call and return the same results under a uniformed condition.
Servers that can meet this criteria are added to the pool as ‚Äúpool
members‚Äù, also known as ‚Äúnodes‚Äù. For our eraser company web
server pool, any server in the pool would have to return identical
results as any other server for a client who requests <code>‚ÄúGET / HTTP/1.0‚Äù.</code></p>

<p>A pool is assembled to operate together. Unknowingly to any
connecting client, when they make a connection to the eraser
company's web site, their request is handed off to any pool member,
or node, to be processed.</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_206c8444.png" NAME="graphics3" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 1: A Basic Pool</I>
</p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<p>A pool member is commonly referred to as
‚Äúnode‚Äù, or a single entity operating in a group which is separate
from other pool members (nodes) but is configured to work within the
pool to achieve the pool's greater functionality, which in our
example is to serve up the web site of our fictional company.
</p>

<p>Besides the identity of ‚Äúnode‚Äù, a pool member has also been
referred to as ‚Äúmember‚Äù, ‚Äúreal server‚Äù, or simply ‚Äúserver‚Äù.
This identity of a pool member is named by the creator of a software
that utilizes pooling concepts for its own use.</p>

<p>A pool can be assembled to achieve any strategy including
Clustering, failover, or simple Load-balancing.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><B>failover</B></p>

<p>If you are going door-to-door collecting canned goods, you won't
drive to a rural home to make a request because your trip is wasted
if no one is at home. Instead you will drive to a neighborhood and
knock on the closest door for your request. If no one answers, you
simply walk next door to make the request again to the neighbor.</p>

<p>When one server fails to respond to a client's request, the pool
configured for a failover strategy should cause all requests to go to
a second server in the same pool. Typically failover is a
configuration to have one server respond to all requests, but then
also have a secondary server waiting to answer the requests as soon
as the first server becomes unavailable due to failure.</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_37965ce8.png" NAME="graphics4" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 2: Generic failover pool</I>
</p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<p>A failover strategy is used to provide a higher
level of availability. Let's say our fictional eraser company creates
a two-node failover pool to serve their website. If the node one web
server has a blown power supply that causes it to fail, the node two
web server in the pool should be configured to immediately take over
reception of the requests in place of the node one web server.
Although the node one web server is down, requests are failed over to
the node two web server and the client web user does not notice any
significant down time. Any actual down time will be the time it takes
between node one web server's failure and node two web server's start
time in responding to requests, which may be insignificant.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><B>Cluster</B></p>

<p>When you call the technical support line for your favorite
software, you know that there is more than one person at the end of
that phone line hired to take your personal call. When a support
person answers your phone call, they enter your information into the
computer including your problem. When they help you work through part
of the issue, it is all documented in a ticket as a transaction. You
are then given the reference number for this ticket so that that when
you call back and get someone else next time, they can know
everything that happened in the previous transaction and continue on
from there. You don't have to start the whole process over again with
the second support person. Clusters are configured to work in a
similar way.</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_m5f121b76.png" NAME="graphics5" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 3: Generic cluster pool</I>
</p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<p>A pool that is configured for clustering is
similar to a failover pool except all nodes in the pool are
responding to incoming requests at the same time, and all nodes share
information on the client users that are connecting to them, and
shares any data sent by the client. For some special needs, clusters
have been designed to contain nodes configured to work on parts of a
single transaction, or single work request.
</p>

<p>In our example, the web site for the eraser company can be
configured with a cluster of web servers. When the client web user
connects to the pool, a single node will receive the request, process
it and send back the results. When the web user connects again to a
successive URI the web user can get a different node in the pool
which will receive the request, process it and send back the results.
In the background inside the pool, the web server nodes are sharing a
session among them on this common web user client. The web user
client identifies itself to the pool each time with a session id. The
session is retrieved (or created if it does not exist) based on this
session id, updated, and the modification are sent to the other nodes
in the pool after the transaction is complete. All pool member nodes
maintain a copy of every session of every client user that connects
to the pool, even if the web user does not connect to the node. If
the client sends data to the pool member, that data as well must be
delivered to all pool member nodes. In the case of our example eraser
company's web site, the data submitted by a client web user might be
stored in a common database all web server nodes access.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><B>Controller</B></p>

<p STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in"><IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_m2b6f4e79.png" NAME="graphics6" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 4: Controller for a pool</I>
</p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<p>A typical configuration of a pool, especially
in a cluster, is to implement a master control service on a server
designed to negotiate what node a client user's request is to be
received by. Requests from the client user will come into the pool to
this master control service which then redirects the request to any
pool member node based on some type of logic. In some cluster
configurations, the master control service can even split the task
request up to be processed in parallel on multiple node members.
</p>

<p>The logic a master control service uses to direct requests to pool
member nodes could be some of the following examples:
</p>
<OL>
	<LI><p>failover: Send all requests to
	node A first, if node A goes down, send requests to node B</p>
	<LI><p>round robin: Send the first
	request to node A, the second to node B, the third to node C, etc</p>
	<LI><p>least connections: Send the next
	request to the node with the least number of connections</p>
	<LI><p>best route: Send the next request to the node closest to the
	client user</p>
</OL>

<p>Some terms used to identify this master controller can be:
load-balancer, cluster-head, director, traffic manager, and
controller.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><B>Virtual Server</B></p>

<p STYLE="margin-top: 0.08in">
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_4402aeba.png" NAME="graphics9" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 5: Virtual Server and controller</I></p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<p>When a controller is configured to direct
traffic among several pool members, the client must know to connect
to the controller. The client wants to connect to a server, however.
So we assign a server name to the controller that a client will
connect to, with the resulting physical connection handed off to a
real server in the pool. This assignment of a server name to the
controller is termed Virtual Server. The controller is not the real
server that handles the request, but it represents a larger virtual
server that is made up of several real server nodes that work
together as one unit we refer to as a pool.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p><B>State Management</B></p>

<p>Pretty much anything can go through stages or a life cycle. You
can identify defined points in this cycle as a state, or the state in
which something is in. A newly purchased ice cream cone is almost
frozen, then it gets soft, then melts, and finally turns to liquid.
You could say the states of an uneaten ice cream cone are frozen,
soft, melting, and liquid.</p>

<p>In the same way, a server can be assigned states evaluated by its
monitored status. We would choose the server to be identified as
states of ACTIVE, server is responding, STANDBY, server is waiting to
take over as ACTIVE, and FAIL, server fails to meet the criteria for
being ACTIVE or STANDBY. The evaluated status would be OK server is
operating within normal parameters, INFO non-critical occurrence
occurred, WARN server operating outside of normal parameters,
CRITICAL server not recovering back to normal parameters, and FAIL
server failed to respond or recover.</p>

<p>The theory of server state management is to evaluate a server
through a cycle defined by an administrator or software maker. The
only reason to monitor a server's status and transition it through
states is to provide data that can be used in logic for negotiating
what to do with the server.</p>

<p>Nagios, for example, will transition a server through states to
allow the administrator to define under what circumstances it should
be notified of the server's status. The administrator might assign
the state of WARN if the server does not respond after 1 failed
response, and the state of FAIL after 3 failed responses. The
administrator only wants to be notified if the server is more
assuredly not responding, so the administrator configures Nagios to
send an alert only when the server reaches a state of FAIL. When one
request fails once in a while due to network congestion, the server
transitions from OK to WARN to OK to WARN to OK, etc. The
administrator does not want to be alerted for these transitions.</p>

<p>MPP in a similar way uses state management to negotiate how
primary control should be transferred from one server to another, or
negotiate how all servers in a pool might be used by a controller.
There is a discussion on how MPP uses state management for a failover
strategy in a later section.</p>

<H3>Linux Heartbeat for failover</H3>

<p>The Linux High-Availability project provides for a traditional
solution for hardware failover, which can be applied to MySQL.</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_145b9b5f.png" NAME="graphics1" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<I>Illustration 7: A two-node failover strategy</I>
</p>

<p>In illustration #1, you see two MySQL servers nodes operating as a
pool for failover. MySQL#1 with IP 10.0.0.1 and MySQL#2 with IP
10.0.0.2. In this example our MySQL server daemon is binding to IP
192.168.2.1. The Web Server is running on a third server with the Web
Server daemon bound to IP 192.168.1.1.</p>

<p>The two MySQL servers are configured as two nodes in a failover
strategy using heartbeat as the controller. The controller,
heartbeat, decides which of the two server nodes (MySQL#1 or MySQL#2)
responds to requests by configuring the main IP (192.168.2.1) on the
responding node. The Web Server makes a MySQL connection to which
every server node is using the 192.168.2.1 IP number. This is all the
Web Server is concerned with. It just wants to connect to a MySQL
Server Daemon on IP 192.168.2.1. It does not care which server it is
physically located on.</p>

<p>In the background, the MySQL Server daemons are replicating data
back and forth to each other to stay in sync. So whatever is written
to MySQL#1 is replicated to MySQL#2. If a failover occurs, MySQL#2
should have the same data state as MySQL#1 from replication **. The
web server can reconnect to 192.168.2.1, now served by MySQL#2, and
keep on going despite the failure of MySQL#1.</p>

<p>** (Although all data should ideally be replicated to MySQL#2
before the failure of MySQL#1, MySQL#2 might be a few seconds behind
in inserting that data. Heartbeat scripts should be written by the
administrator to wait until MySQL#2 is caught up with replication
before activating the IP on that server.)</p>

<p>The failover process that occurs is monitored and executed by
Heartbeat. Heartbeat will run on MySQL#2 and constantly monitor the
health (or heartbeat) of MySQL#1. Should MySQL#1 no longer respond to
Heartbeat's monitoring process on MySQL#2, then Heartbeat on MySQL#2
will configure the 192.168.2.1 IP number on MySQL#2 and bind the
MySQL process to that IP number. This is all done with scripts that
are executed by Heartbeat.</p>

<p>If Heartbeat is running on MySQL#1, then Heartbeat can be
configured to allow MySQL#1 to retake the 192.168.2.1 IP number back
when it comes back online.</p>

<p>This configuration is a good and easy way of creating a failover
strategy for a MySQL deployment. However, any small details of the
MySQL Daemon process you wish to monitor for failure and have a
failover occur for must be programmed yourself with Heartbeat, which
is entirely possible. With this strategy, one IP is being passed
around multiple servers.</p>



<p><br /><br /></p>



<H3>Linux Virtual Server for Clustering</H3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>The basic goal of the Linux Virtual Server Project is to build a
high-performance and highly available server for Linux using
clustering technology, which provides good scalability, reliability
and serviceability.</p>

<p>LVS is used as a clustering or general load-balancing technology.
Several (pool) real servers (nodes) sit behind the LVS load balancer
(controller) server. A process on the LVS load balancer monitors the
state of each real server. If the state of the real server is
positive (OK), then the real server is maintained in a list of
available real servers. If the state of the real server is negative
(FAIL), then it is dropped from the list of available real servers.
When the LVS load balancer receives a request from a client, it
chooses an available real server to forward the request on to. The
remaining requested session is completed between the requesting
client and real server. 
</p>

<p>
<IMG SRC="MySQLStateManagementWithSitetoSiteFailover-1_2-p1_5177d61b.png" NAME="graphics7" BORDER=0>
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 8: A three-node cluster with controller</I>
</p>

<p>To determine if the real server's state is positive or
negative, the LVS load balancer makes a defined TCP connection to the
real server or executes an external &quot;check script&quot; provided
by the administrator. The TCP connection is simply a connection
similar to telneting to a port and receiving an expected string. An
example would be connecting via TCP to port 80, sending the string
&quot;GET / HTTP/1.0&quot; and receiving the string &quot;200 OK&quot;.
If a 500 error were received, the real server would be removed from
the availability list. This example is shown in illustration #2.
</p>

<p>To be more accurate in determining a positive or negative state,
the LVS administrator would create a health monitor check script to
be executed which may connect to the HTTP Server, receive the
requested HTML page, and parse it for an expected string. This not
only ensures the web server is running, but serving the expected
results too.</p>

<p>The default MySQL health monitor check script which comes with LVS
is a basic TCP connection to ensure MySQL is still responding on its
port. However, this does not check whether a normal user connection
can be made through the server login mechanism, if an SQL statement
can be executed, or if the replication link between a master and
slave is OK (If the MySQL server is operating correctly as a
replica).</p>

<p>There is a MySQL health monitor check script which comes with LVS
that logs in as a defined user, and requests a listing of tables in a
defined database. This is a much better health check, but still does
not produce a positive or negative from the consideration of the
status of a MySQL replication link or other factors.</p>

<p>Ideally, MySQL server nodes should be monitored to ensure they are
receiving connections, handling requests, and successfully
replicating. The status of the MySQL server should then be determined
based on this discovery, and a resulting state should evaluated in
comparison with other pool member nodes. If a MySQL server is behind
in replication, you'd want that labeled on the node within the pool
so requests are sent elsewhere until it is caught up.</p>

<p>LVS by itself with these check scripts cannot do much more than
simply load-balance connections between multiple MySQL server nodes.</p>

<p>If you combine Heartbeat with LVS, you can have heartbeat
physically take a MySQL server node down if it is not performing
correctly, and load-balance read-only SQL select statements between
the master and slave if they are both running in good condition.**</p>

<p>(Configuring LVS for load-balancing read-only SQL statements
requires creating two separate virtual servers, pools, consisting of
the same nodes as pool members in each. One virtual server will
direct requests to the node which heartbeat has the primary IP
assigned to. The other virtual server will monitor the nodes to see
which ones heartbeat has not taken offline yet. The application will
need to be aware of which virtual server is the read-only virtual
server, and which is the read-write. To do this with one virtual
server (one pool), you would need to use MySQL Proxy in place of LVS.
MySQL Proxy can filter SQL statements and direct them accordingly.)</p>

<p>LVS was designed to be the controller of a generic cluster, but
whether or not the pool members of an LVS virtual server is actually
part of a cluster is determined by how they interact with each other
inthe pool. Technically and simply, if multiple nodes can process
multiple requests in parallel on the same data source without
affecting each other negatively, it can be termed a cluster.</p>

<p>In our examples, clustered web servers would have to instantly
share user sessions and any uploaded data. Clustered MySQL nodes
would have to instantly share any data modifications resulting from
user SQL transactions. If the nodes cannot share the data instantly,
then they would negatively impact other nodes that need to handle
requests also utilizing that data. In this later case the pool nodes
should be configured for failover instead of clustering.</p>



<p><br /><br /></p>



<H3>A State Management Concept for MySQL</H3>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Heartbeat and LVS can be working solutions for MySQL. However,
they were not originally created to specifically control MySQL nodes.
They were originally created to do their job generically for any
technology, and they left the specifics up to the end users to fine
tune it for their software application.</p>

<p>Fine tuning these applications for MySQL can be a challenge.
Negotiation of directing incoming connections has to be determined.
Unlike a web server which is typically read-only, or any data sent to
them (like uploading a file) is very minimal, MySQL manages a large
amount of data which is constantly being read from and written to.</p>

<p>There are several metrics that must be monitored and measured to
ensure a MySQL server is in a state we can consider is ‚Äúgood
health‚Äù.</p>

<UL>
	<LI><p>Can we connect to the MySQL server (MySQL can set a limit on
	allowed connections, the server crashed, or the MySQL server daemon
	might not be running)?</p>
	<LI><p>Do we have privileges to execute SQL queries (permissions can
	change on accident or on purpose)?</p>
	<LI><p>Can we execute a SQL statement and get a result (there are
	many situations in which an unoptimized SQL statement from a web
	server can accidentally lock the database too long causing newer
	requests to get queued up)?</p>
	<LI><p>Is the slave MySQL server replication up to date with the
	master MySQL server (the slave could be working on getting caught up
	on replication if it were behind, and the slave would exhibit an
	error message saying it is X seconds behind the master. This could
	be 7 seconds behind or 340 seconds behind, as examples)?</p>
	<LI><p>Has the slave MySQL server replication stopped (the slave can
	stop replication if a master binary log becomes corrupted, there is
	a network connectivity issue, the disk becomes full, or there is a
	conflict between the slaves data and the data replicated from the
	master. There are many other potential causes too)?</p>
</UL>

<p>In a few of these circumstances we may want to give a server time
to return to ‚Äúgood health‚Äù before we label it as having failed
completely.</p>

<UL>
	<LI><p>A single connection was dropped due to an unusual network
	bandwidth spike.</p>
	<LI><p>The MySQL server was not accepting connections for 5 seconds
	while the network administrator changed its port on the network
	switch.</p>
	<LI><p>There was a temporary read-lock on all tables while the
	database administrator performed a backup of the data,</p>
	<LI><p>The replica slave is a little behind on replication and it
	just needs a few seconds to get caught up.</p>
	<LI><p>The replica slave's replication stopped while the database
	administrator changed it's master.</p>
</UL>

<p>We can manage these circumstances by transitioning the MySQL
server nodes through states. And by utilizing the results of managed
states, we can have the power to promote and demote servers. Let's
refer back to the earlier description on State Management.</p>

<I>Illustration 9: Evaluations</I>
</p>

<p>If we want to manage a pool of three MySQL nodes in a failover
configuration, one server node will be evaluated as UP at any given
time, and the other two server nodes should be evaluated as DOWN.
</p>

<p>Now let's say we want the second and third nodes that are
evaluated as DOWN to also serve read-only SQL statements. We will
have another evaluation of READ-ONLY for these two nodes, and the
first node should be evaluated as READ-WRITE.</p>

<p>Now that we know what results we want the three MySQL nodes to be
evaluated as, we need to define the criteria that will be used in
these evaluations.</p>

<p>The first criteria we want to identify the MySQL nodes with is
what order of priority they have in the pool. If there is a
promotion, which server is first? Let's define two types of server
nodes, PRIMARY and SECONDARY. A server with TYPE of PRIMARY will be
first in line for everything. If the pool comes online for the first
time, the PRIMARY server node will be set to handle the requests. A
server with TYPE of SECONDARY will be second in line to take over
what the PRIMARY server node does. In our case we have three MySQL
nodes, and so the second and third nodes are both identified as the
first SECONDARY and second SECONDARY respectively. The two SECONDARY
server nodes will be evaluated for promotion equally in the pool, but
in the case that both nodes are equally in good health, they will be
promoted in their order. The first SECONDARY node will be promoted
first, and the second SECONDARY node will be promoted if the first
fails.</p>

<p>For the second criteria, we need to identify what STATE each MySQL
node is in. We need to know which node is handling requests, which
are waiting to take over, and which are offline, An ACTIVE node will
handle requests, STANDBY nodes will be waiting to take over as ACTIVE
when the ACTIVE node fails, and FAIL will be assigned to a node which
has failed and cannot serve as either ACTIVE or STANDBY. Another
state we must be aware of is a node which a STATE has not been
determined for. When the pool first comes online, no nodes have been
evaluated, so all nodes are assigned the STATE of UNKNOWN. We cannot
simply assume a node is OK before we evaluate it. We do not want to
report anything we are not certain of.</p>

<I>Illustration 10: Node Status, State and Type</I>
</p>

<p>The last criteria we will identify is the STATUS of each MySQL
node. The two obvious STATUS identifications are OK, the node is in
good health, and FAIL, the node is in bad health.
</p>

<p>However we cannot simply transition a MySQL node from OK to FAIL.
We identified earlier several circumstances in which a MySQL node may
be temporarily unavailable for a matter of seconds. We want to give
the nodes time to recover, but we also do not want to keep reporting
the nodes as OK when we start seeing issues. It is possible the node
could recover, but it could also be possible the node has actually
failed.</p>

<p>So in addition to the STATUS of OK and FAIL, we want to add WARN
and CRITICAL to give the nodes a transitional period to allow time
for recovery, and also give time to prepare other nodes in the pool
to compensate for this node potentially going down.</p>

<p>And the last STATUS identification is INFO, which allows us to put
the node in a condition to report an occurrence, but not necessarily
evaluate it as being in bad health. Having a STATUS of INFO also
allows a transition transaction to occur so that a monitoring system
could pick up the transition change and send a notification to an
administrator.</p>

<p>Our complete list off statuses are: OK, INFO, WARN, CRITICAL, and
FAIL. This order will also be the flow we will transition the MySQL
nodes through when problems arise. 
</p>

<p>Our transition of STATUS and STATE for a server node does not
dictate each others' identification. We may transition a server node
through 4 STATUS changes before it can be identified as FAIL, but it
does not mean that a STATUS of FAIL must be identified before the
STATE can also be FAIL. We evaluate the STATUS based on metrics we
gather from what we monitor. We evaluate the STATE based on four
parts: the server node's STATUS, the STATE of other nodes in the
pool, configurable preferences for the pool, and logic we assign to
the pool.</p>

<p>Assuming the PRIMARY node is ACTIVE, we could set the PRIMARY
node's STATE to FAIL only when its STATUS is also is FAIL. However,
we may choose to failover ACTIVE STATUS to a STANDBY server node when
the PRIMARY server reaches a STATUS of WARN, the first sign of a
problem. We may then allow the PRIMARY server to retake the STATE of
ACTIVE if it recovers to a STATUS of OK.</p>

<p>MPP has been designed to monitor certain server node metrics,
evaluate those metrics to determine a server node's STATUS, and
evaluate all server nodes' STATE and STATUS identities in a pool to
determine the STATE of a single pool member server node. MPP will
group these server nodes into a pool and manage them as just
described according to their configured membership position, or TYPE.</p>

<p>In a failover configuration, for the READ-WRITE virtual server, we
can configure the STATE of ACTIVE as UP, and any other STATE as DOWN.
For the READ-ONLY virtual server we can configure the STATE of
STANDBY as UP and any other STATE as DOWN.</p>



<p><br /><br /></p>



<H3>Using State Management for a failover Strategy</H3>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>Implementing the previous state manage concept with a 2<SUP>nd</SUP>
party controller, like LVS or MySQL Proxy, can create a failover
strategy. MPP will evaluate each pool member node to determine each
node's STATE and STATUS. The 2<SUP>nd</SUP> party controller will
then use MPP's resulting evaluation to physically control how the
node will participate in the pool it manages.</p>

<p>Using the previously illustrated evaluations as the basis for
configuration of the controller, we make the controller physically
manage the nodes as MPP dictates.</p>

<I>Illustration 11: Criteria for the Evaluations</I>
</p>


<p>To use MPP to load balance between READ-ONLY and READ-WRITE,
the controller will need to be aware of  their nature of select
(read) or update, delete and insert (write) and be able to direct
traffic on this determination to the appropriate node.
</p>

<p>If the controller is not aware of the nature of SQL queries, then
it will have to be configured to use the single pool managed by MPP
as two virtual servers. One virtual server configuration will monitor
all pool member nodes for READ-WRITE status, and the other will
monitor pool member nodes for READ-ONLY status.</p>

<I>Illustration 12: LVS with read-write and read-only Virtual Servers</I>
</p>

<p>MySQL Proxy is able to decipher and be aware of
the nature of SQL queries, as it was created to filter SQL queries
and perform other advanced mechanics. It is capable of load-balancing
READ-ONLY vs. READ-WRITE SQL Queries. The application only makes one
connection to the virtual server managed by MySQL Proxy and does not
need to be aware of the nature of the SQL query.
</p>

<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<I>Illustration 13: MySQL Proxy with one Virtual Server</I>
</p>

<p>LVS, on the other hand, only works on the
connection level and does not filter what is transmitted over the
connection. It is only capable of negotiating the load-balancing of
connections. If both READ-ONLY and READ-WRITE virtual servers are
configured in LVS, the application needing a connection will be
responsible for determining which virtual server to use. LVS will
still manage the nodes for each virtual server according to the
defined criteria.
</p>

<p>Once the virtual servers are configured in the controller, all
pool member nodes are defined under the virtual server as well as
within MPP's managed pool, and the controller is querying MPP to
retrieve the criteria for its evaluations, we have a managed pool.
The power of the controller is leveraged with the state management of
MPP.</p>

<p>Currently MPP only has logic for one type of pool, failover. Your
pool managed by MPP and controlled by the controller will operate in
a failover strategy. If the ACTIVE server begins to fail, it will be
demoted and a STANDBY in good health will be promoted in its place.
If a STANDBY fails, it will be demoted.</p>

<p>To ensure a fail-safe operation of replica MySQL server nodes in a
pool, which is not reading or writing to a node when its replication
is broken for example, the controller should be configured to take
the node DOWN when the STATUS transitions from OK to WARN. This will
cut off applications already connected or in the process of
connecting to the failing node. If a node is evaluated to be in bad
health, but is still able to accept connections, we want it cut off
so no data can be written to it or read from it by accident from an
application. In this way you are configuring STANDBY server nodes to
be marked down the moment a problem with replication is detected. And
if you are using STANDBY server nodes for READ-ONLY queries, then
this can give you a better guarantee that the SQL queries are being
processed by a MySQL server node that is not behind in replication.</p>

<p>For the ACTIVE node in the pool, you will instead want to define
the STATUS that will trigger a failover to a healthy STANDBY node
before taking it DOWN.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<H3>Remarks</H3>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>In this Part 1 I talk about an application for State Management
called MPP. Part 2 will go more in depth on the mechanics and
operation of MPP, with more details on MPP+LVS combination. You can
download the code for this application from CodePin,
<A HREF="http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp">http://codepin.cait.org/project/mpp</A>
</p>

<p>Part 3 will introduce using MPP with MySQL Proxy.</p>
<p>Currently a plan is in progress to integrate MPP into MySQL Proxy
to provide faster failover time, better monitoring, and lighter
resource management. More details are available from MPP's project
page on CodePin.</p>
